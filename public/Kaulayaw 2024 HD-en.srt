1
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:09,113
What do you want to see, baby?

2
00:00:13,534 --> 00:00:15,896
For 200 coins,

3
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,330
I'll give you what you want.

4
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:36,182
What?

5
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:39,281
I said 200 for two.

6
00:00:45,164 --> 00:00:47,688
That's what I'm saying, baby.

7
00:00:58,915 --> 00:01:01,364
Oh, shit!
One moment guys...

8
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:15,221
Go on...

9
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,808
- I’ll go.
- You should rest.

10
00:01:19,911 --> 00:01:20,911
Go ahead.

11
00:01:41,374 --> 00:01:42,501
“Collab.”

12
00:01:43,922 --> 00:01:45,504
“We thought it was a collab.”

13
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:52,348
“One thousand coins for a collab.”

14
00:01:53,175 --> 00:01:54,260
Collab?

15
00:01:55,179 --> 00:01:56,263
With whom?

16
00:01:57,046 --> 00:01:58,572
With Cara?

17
00:02:02,155 --> 00:02:05,947
“We want some F2F action.”

18
00:02:07,872 --> 00:02:09,471
Oh, you guys...

19
00:02:29,795 --> 00:02:30,880
Date?

20
00:02:31,797 --> 00:02:32,982
Uh...

21
00:02:33,007 --> 00:02:36,377
Yeah, it's been a while since
Migo and I saw each other.

22
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,759
How about you, do you have work?

23
00:02:39,018 --> 00:02:40,264
Isn't it your day off?

24
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:43,166
Our client said there's
an emergency meeting.

25
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:44,760
Oh...

26
00:02:49,277 --> 00:02:50,877
Okay, good luck.

27
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:53,846
Hey, girl...

28
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:55,848
- By the way...
- What?

29
00:02:56,316 --> 00:02:57,541
My...

30
00:02:58,005 --> 00:03:00,666
My share of the apartment rent...

31
00:03:00,993 --> 00:03:02,036
can I pass for now?

32
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:05,119
The client hasn't paid yet.

33
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,010
Hmm...

34
00:03:07,035 --> 00:03:10,283
Okay. I'll try to
borrow from Migo,

35
00:03:10,565 --> 00:03:14,356
but make sure to pay because you know,
I don't have extra funds.

36
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:15,549
Of course, girl.

37
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:18,304
- Okay, then... bye.
- Take care.

38
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:20,026
- Bye!
- Enjoy!

39
00:03:31,728 --> 00:03:33,932
Hi, Boss! Good morning!

40
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:36,721
Hi, Ella.
This meeting will be short.

41
00:03:37,212 --> 00:03:40,674
The company reviewed its finances
and it looks like we need to let you go.

42
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:42,067
Sir?

43
00:03:42,906 --> 00:03:44,205
Is it my rate?

44
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:46,721
I can lower my hourly rate.

45
00:03:47,014 --> 00:03:49,600
I'm sorry, Ella.
We're just in a tight spot

46
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,862
and we can no longer afford
your services.

47
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:55,205
If you need recommendations,
I can give you one.

48
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:02,190
Babe, aren't we going to miss
the restaurant?

49
00:04:02,612 --> 00:04:04,049
It’s getting late.

50
00:04:04,401 --> 00:04:07,057
Shh... we'll find another place.

51
00:04:07,619 --> 00:04:09,908
Migo, it's been so long
since we last saw each other.

52
00:04:10,424 --> 00:04:13,463
You prioritized
that student council thing...

53
00:04:20,862 --> 00:04:23,408
Shh... I'm almost there.

54
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:41,230
Thanks babe...

55
00:04:42,444 --> 00:04:43,445
I’ll...

56
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,848
I'll freshen up,
then we can go, okay?

57
00:05:55,346 --> 00:05:57,753
Hey! When are you
coming to my dorm?

58
00:05:57,778 --> 00:05:59,096
I’m all alone.

59
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,681
- Babe, I can explain...
- Damn you, Migo!

60
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,510
How I wish...

61
00:06:25,429 --> 00:06:27,689
Have some guts, Ella!

62
00:06:27,932 --> 00:06:28,932
[sighs]

63
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,315
"Hey!"

64
00:06:33,807 --> 00:06:36,083
“I saw your post.”

65
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:38,065
“You’re looking great.”

66
00:06:38,934 --> 00:06:43,393
“Maybe you can let me in
on your business.”

67
00:06:47,133 --> 00:06:49,933
Where are you?
Migo is looking for you.

68
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,213
He said you fought with him.

69
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:54,073
Ma, please don’t get involved
this time, okay?

70
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,538
What did you fight about?

71
00:06:56,562 --> 00:06:58,807
Are you just being
a drama queen again?

72
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,713
Ma, he cheated on me,

73
00:07:02,087 --> 00:07:03,481
he was with another woman.

74
00:07:03,784 --> 00:07:07,229
He said he was just busy
with that damn student council.

75
00:07:07,424 --> 00:07:10,088
And I, like a fool, believed him.

76
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:13,385
I thought maybe he was just busy
with his campaign.

77
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:16,957
And then what?
I find out he's just cheating on me?

78
00:07:18,054 --> 00:07:20,056
Maybe Migo is just stressed.

79
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:23,104
His father has high expectations of him.

80
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:26,760
People make mistakes.
Don't you love him anymore?

81
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,651
Ma, are you siding with him?

82
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,338
I’m not that stupid!

83
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:33,602
It's your decision...

84
00:07:33,627 --> 00:07:36,049
I'm just saying...
can you handle it?

85
00:07:37,276 --> 00:07:39,432
Why wouldn't I handle it?
Who does he think he is?

86
00:07:39,886 --> 00:07:42,799
No one will drive you
to school anymore.

87
00:07:42,824 --> 00:07:45,940
No one will give you the gifts you want.

88
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,922
Remember, you got to tour Hong Kong

89
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:51,119
because Migo's family brought you along.

90
00:07:51,144 --> 00:07:52,916
Think about it, dear.

91
00:07:53,344 --> 00:07:54,681
Damn it!

92
00:07:59,090 --> 00:08:00,383
Damn it!

93
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:03,057
Are you cursing at me, dear?

94
00:08:06,874 --> 00:08:07,955
Hey...

95
00:08:08,351 --> 00:08:09,978
What happened to you?

96
00:08:18,062 --> 00:08:20,157
Migo and I broke up...

97
00:08:21,088 --> 00:08:22,274
What?

98
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:24,922
Did you manage to borrow
the money I need?

99
00:08:25,734 --> 00:08:28,028
- Ella, come on!
- Just kidding!

100
00:08:28,053 --> 00:08:29,891
What happened?

101
00:08:30,507 --> 00:08:33,657
The jerk is seeing another girl.

102
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,883
But I'm not sure
if I made the right decision.

103
00:08:37,246 --> 00:08:38,747
Of course you did!

104
00:08:39,343 --> 00:08:40,727
What are you thinking?

105
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:45,594
Don't let anyone cheat on you
and treat you like trash.

106
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:49,305
Do you want us to get back at him?

107
00:08:49,383 --> 00:08:50,937
[whining]

108
00:08:57,341 --> 00:08:59,422
Good thing the guard let you in.

109
00:09:01,441 --> 00:09:04,081
I said I was getting my transcript.

110
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,868
So, what's up?
How are you?

111
00:09:06,699 --> 00:09:09,875
That’s just it...
Do you have a side gig for me?

112
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,880
Aren't you working as a virtual assistant?

113
00:09:11,905 --> 00:09:13,341
You were making good money there, right?

114
00:09:13,366 --> 00:09:14,919
I got let go.

115
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:16,812
I really need work now.

116
00:09:17,286 --> 00:09:18,540
So many bills...

117
00:09:18,912 --> 00:09:20,993
Plus, tuition fees are due.

118
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,670
What if I just lend you the money?

119
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,852
Because you might not be able
to handle the work.

120
00:09:25,877 --> 00:09:29,423
I need a job more.
I can handle it. Anything.

121
00:09:29,536 --> 00:09:33,141
Well... Are you familiar
with PleasureHub?

122
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:37,586
You make porn?

123
00:09:43,979 --> 00:09:46,023
Well, let's just say...

124
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:48,304
I'm a PleasureHub model.

125
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:50,461
I do shows on the webcam.

126
00:09:50,902 --> 00:09:54,093
Whatever the audience wants, I do it.

127
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:06,084
You have a nice body.
You're beautiful...

128
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:09,963
Why don’t you use it?

129
00:10:12,132 --> 00:10:14,318
What if someone recognizes me?

130
00:10:14,343 --> 00:10:17,840
So what?
Do they feed you?

131
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:20,207
Do they pay your bills?

132
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,535
Just follow my lead.

133
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:30,792
Right now, I have 25 thousand subscribers.

134
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:35,207
We can collaborate on one, or two videos,

135
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:37,520
so you can get some of my subs.

136
00:10:39,045 --> 00:10:42,192
Then you can create your own account.

137
00:10:42,781 --> 00:10:45,559
What would I do on my own account?

138
00:10:52,923 --> 00:10:54,299
Touch yourself...

139
00:10:54,925 --> 00:10:56,301
Masturbate...

140
00:11:00,381 --> 00:11:03,088
Read the comments from time to time,

141
00:11:03,113 --> 00:11:06,682
because sometimes
they just want to see you eat...

142
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,120
while naked.

143
00:11:09,674 --> 00:11:13,932
- And they’ll pay for that?
- Of course! Plus tips.

144
00:12:00,939 --> 00:12:03,806
This is so difficult!
Nobody's giving coins!

145
00:12:07,111 --> 00:12:08,884
Just be patient.

146
00:12:20,846 --> 00:12:23,584
Excuse me...

147
00:12:29,269 --> 00:12:31,545
Is this the list of scholars?

148
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:45,514
- What are you doing here?
- Cara, please, talk to me.

149
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,302
Cara, I know I was wrong...

150
00:12:58,024 --> 00:13:01,162
I’m just human, I make mistakes.
I get tempted.

151
00:13:01,319 --> 00:13:04,037
But I never doubted my feelings.

152
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,442
- You’re the one I love.
- I told you to stop it!

153
00:13:11,478 --> 00:13:13,438
I don’t have time for your nonsense!

154
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,808
Cara, please...

155
00:13:17,971 --> 00:13:22,327
Sir, is the list of scholars
posted on the bulletin final?

156
00:13:22,466 --> 00:13:23,610
Yes, hija.

157
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:29,123
My name isn't on the list.
But I'm a scholar.

158
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,896
What's your full name?

159
00:13:31,081 --> 00:13:32,850
Cara Sta. Ines...

160
00:13:32,903 --> 00:13:35,444
It looks like you dropped
out of the ranking this semester.

161
00:13:36,409 --> 00:13:39,327
There are too many applicants
for the scholarship,

162
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:42,397
so the committee raised the cut-off.

163
00:13:42,764 --> 00:13:45,936
- Can I still petition?
- Yes, you can...

164
00:13:46,358 --> 00:13:49,569
but hearings for those petitions
take a long time.

165
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:52,787
I suggest that you apply again
next semester.

166
00:13:53,006 --> 00:13:55,319
- Okay?
- Okay, sir.

167
00:14:06,342 --> 00:14:08,800
Migo told me your scholarship got revoked.

168
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:11,082
He’s willing to lend you money.

169
00:14:11,107 --> 00:14:13,684
I don’t have any money to lend you.

170
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:44,836
Don’t tell me Migo
is bothering you again?

171
00:14:45,475 --> 00:14:46,952
What happened?

172
00:14:47,032 --> 00:14:50,285
- I lost my scholarship.
- What?

173
00:14:50,835 --> 00:14:54,204
How did that happen when your grades
are so high?

174
00:14:54,229 --> 00:14:56,922
They raised the cut-off...

175
00:14:56,993 --> 00:15:00,250
and my mom
is also adding to the pressure.

176
00:15:00,289 --> 00:15:02,599
She wants me to make up with Migo,

177
00:15:02,624 --> 00:15:06,149
because he’ll be willing
to lend me tuition money.

178
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:10,571
But damn it!
It would feel like eating shit!

179
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:14,118
He already cheated on me,
and now I’m supposed to tolerate it?

180
00:15:15,310 --> 00:15:18,271
If there’s really no other option,

181
00:15:19,147 --> 00:15:20,315
then go ahead...

182
00:15:21,024 --> 00:15:24,611
But let’s try to find
another way first, okay?

183
00:15:26,912 --> 00:15:28,372
What about you?

184
00:15:29,121 --> 00:15:31,430
How did you find money for your tuition?

185
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,922
I have a new side gig...

186
00:15:34,188 --> 00:15:35,477
Can I join?

187
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:40,172
Let’s see. I’ll let you know.

188
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,039
Thank you!

189
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,185
Did you cook?

190
00:15:54,719 --> 00:15:56,351
Crazy, of course not!

191
00:15:56,694 --> 00:15:59,508
- I ordered food.
- Wow, you have a budget.

192
00:15:59,898 --> 00:16:04,101
I also paid the water, electricity bills,
and the rent.

193
00:16:06,376 --> 00:16:07,461
Let’s eat.

194
00:16:11,563 --> 00:16:14,640
I haven’t forgotten
our conversation last night.

195
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:18,054
- What conversation?
- That you’d get me into your gig.

196
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,122
Oh...

197
00:16:21,309 --> 00:16:24,390
Are you familiar with PleasureHub?

198
00:16:25,333 --> 00:16:26,333
What’s that?

199
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:28,656
That’s my gig...

200
00:16:41,874 --> 00:16:43,690
Ella... why are you doing this?

201
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:48,540
Why not? I’m able to pay my bills
and tuition, right?

202
00:16:49,372 --> 00:16:51,416
Do people really pay for this?

203
00:16:52,365 --> 00:16:53,450
Well...

204
00:16:53,741 --> 00:16:55,253
honestly,

205
00:16:55,944 --> 00:17:00,390
after several days,
I only get a few dollars.

206
00:17:00,695 --> 00:17:03,752
I’d be lucky if I make 50 dollars
in one live...

207
00:17:05,336 --> 00:17:07,452
Then last night,

208
00:17:07,807 --> 00:17:09,809
when you walked into my room,

209
00:17:10,223 --> 00:17:11,725
my live caught you on camera.

210
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:13,929
And my audience showered me with tips

211
00:17:13,985 --> 00:17:15,460
when they saw you.

212
00:17:16,562 --> 00:17:17,991
What does that mean?

213
00:17:18,016 --> 00:17:20,101
They got excited seeing us.

214
00:17:20,364 --> 00:17:24,156
The both of us...
together in one video.

215
00:17:24,564 --> 00:17:27,062
They want us to collab...

216
00:17:27,134 --> 00:17:30,202
- that’s if you’re interested.
- Collab?

217
00:17:31,629 --> 00:17:33,515
We do a show together live.

218
00:17:33,783 --> 00:17:36,398
Are you crazy?
Why would I do that?

219
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,695
You said you need
money for tuition, right?

220
00:17:40,802 --> 00:17:43,241
Do you prefer to borrow
from that cheater, Migo?

221
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,124
Sorry, but I don’t know
if I can do that.

222
00:17:50,777 --> 00:17:54,859
Okay, fine. No problem.

223
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,366
Wait.

224
00:17:57,555 --> 00:18:00,023
That’s yours.

225
00:18:00,553 --> 00:18:03,210
That’s the tip I got
just because you appeared in my live.

226
00:18:03,727 --> 00:18:07,148
- Are you bribing me?
- Of course not!

227
00:18:08,109 --> 00:18:10,028
I just want you to imagine

228
00:18:10,213 --> 00:18:12,591
how much more you could earn

229
00:18:12,616 --> 00:18:14,765
if we go live together.

230
00:18:20,273 --> 00:18:23,562
Come on, guys,
let us know what you want us to do.

231
00:18:29,456 --> 00:18:32,209
Do you want to see us kiss?

232
00:18:32,593 --> 00:18:34,007
Or...

233
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:37,484
touch each other’s boobs?

234
00:18:48,648 --> 00:18:50,650
Pass the candy?

235
00:18:51,112 --> 00:18:52,154
Do you want...

236
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:56,040
Uh... Do you want me
to pass my candy to her?

237
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,155
Show me some coins...

238
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,975
Oh! Look!

239
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,062
Okay... Thank you! Thank you!

240
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:16,398
Okay, I’ll pass my candy now...

241
00:19:36,364 --> 00:19:37,490
What’s next?

242
00:19:44,190 --> 00:19:45,233
Again?

243
00:19:45,673 --> 00:19:46,757
Again... Again...

244
00:19:46,782 --> 00:19:48,992
Okay. Okay...

245
00:19:51,951 --> 00:19:54,257
Oh! Thank you!

246
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,843
Okay, I’ll...
I’ll feed her now...

247
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,311
So? Is this enough
until next semester?

248
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,562
If we don’t eat or pay our bills.

249
00:20:21,292 --> 00:20:23,405
What else do you want me to do?

250
00:20:23,768 --> 00:20:25,803
I’m even willing to be corny for you.

251
00:20:26,865 --> 00:20:28,937
I don’t do that for any other girl.

252
00:20:28,962 --> 00:20:32,874
Wow, did I force you to do that?
Should I thank you?

253
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:35,468
I already told you,
leave me alone.

254
00:20:37,562 --> 00:20:38,562
Move.

255
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,827
I miss you so much.
Please come back...

256
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:48,264
Ella and I have something to do.
I need to go home.

257
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,270
[sighs] You know...

258
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:54,762
I feel like you’re acting this way
because of Ella.

259
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:56,497
Stay away from her!

260
00:20:57,398 --> 00:20:59,350
I know you live together
at the apartment,

261
00:20:59,857 --> 00:21:02,773
but she’s a bad influence.

262
00:21:03,984 --> 00:21:05,451
What do you mean?

263
00:21:05,939 --> 00:21:08,149
Someone saw her the other day...

264
00:21:08,997 --> 00:21:12,312
she was talking to Melody.
She got kicked out remember?

265
00:21:12,419 --> 00:21:15,046
For being a professor's sugar baby.

266
00:21:15,273 --> 00:21:17,175
Maybe Ella’s the same.

267
00:21:17,199 --> 00:21:18,413
You’re a good girl...

268
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:20,987
that’s why I love you.

269
00:21:23,414 --> 00:21:24,791
Ella’s not like that.

270
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,168
My friend isn’t like that.

271
00:21:27,866 --> 00:21:31,000
And if anyone’s the jerk
between the two of you, it’s you!

272
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,434
Please, don’t bring that up again.

273
00:21:37,001 --> 00:21:38,294
I made a mistake,

274
00:21:39,152 --> 00:21:40,320
and I’m sorry.

275
00:21:41,112 --> 00:21:45,099
I just needed to release some tension
because I was so stressed out.

276
00:21:47,561 --> 00:21:49,192
But you’re the one I love.

277
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:52,457
I can’t lose you...

278
00:25:16,786 --> 00:25:18,207
Hey, guys!

279
00:25:18,345 --> 00:25:22,004
So, we have a glow-in-the-dark dildo.

280
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:26,324
You can see it in action for 300 coins...

281
00:25:31,137 --> 00:25:33,727
Cara will be here soon, don’t worry.

282
00:28:59,925 --> 00:29:00,926
Hey...

283
00:29:01,437 --> 00:29:03,035
Why are you in such a rush?

284
00:29:03,223 --> 00:29:05,534
There’s no classes, it’s a weekend.

285
00:29:05,598 --> 00:29:08,286
Exactly. I'm meeting up with Migo.

286
00:29:08,441 --> 00:29:11,942
Cara, are you sure
about what you're doing?

287
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,731
Dear, don’t worry...

288
00:29:15,632 --> 00:29:18,427
I’ll still help with PleasureHub.

289
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:21,121
Besides, I also need to earn some money...

290
00:29:21,193 --> 00:29:25,559
Then why go back to Migo?
You don’t need him anymore.

291
00:29:25,762 --> 00:29:29,879
I felt that his apology was genuine.

292
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:33,973
You know, we should hang out sometime,
the three of us.

293
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:36,528
So you can see that he's really okay.

294
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,060
Oh!

295
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:40,208
Wait.

296
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:44,595
- Hello, babe?
- Babe, I'll pick you up in 30 minutes?

297
00:29:44,895 --> 00:29:46,772
Okay, sure, I’ll get ready.

298
00:29:47,871 --> 00:29:49,020
Okay, bye.

299
00:29:50,777 --> 00:29:51,831
I need to go...

300
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:59,791
- Cheers!
- Cheers everyone!

301
00:32:06,779 --> 00:32:08,030
That’s solid!

302
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:11,377
[groans]

303
00:32:13,536 --> 00:32:16,650
- One more!
- One more?

304
00:32:19,025 --> 00:32:20,523
Not too much...

305
00:32:20,548 --> 00:32:24,455
Dear, just a reminder,
your tolerance for alcohol is low.

306
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:26,916
Migo is here...

307
00:32:27,984 --> 00:32:31,041
Come on.
I can take care of my girl.

308
00:32:31,595 --> 00:32:33,013
More shots!

309
00:32:33,038 --> 00:32:34,830
- Shot!
- Let’s go!

310
00:32:35,583 --> 00:32:36,709
Shot!

311
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:40,370
Cheers!

312
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,024
Yeah, Ella...

313
00:32:44,986 --> 00:32:46,696
Don’t be such a killjoy!

314
00:32:47,323 --> 00:32:48,323
Ugh!

315
00:32:49,459 --> 00:32:52,385
- Damn, it burns.
- Huh?

316
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:57,830
- It burns, baby?
- Mm-hmm.

317
00:32:57,855 --> 00:32:59,142
Wait, wait...

318
00:33:01,461 --> 00:33:04,103
- Does it still hurt?
- Yeah, it does!

319
00:33:04,128 --> 00:33:05,346
Where? Here?

320
00:33:05,371 --> 00:33:06,371
Oh!

321
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:07,689
One more...

322
00:33:07,921 --> 00:33:11,103
- I think it still hurts...
- Yeah, here...

323
00:34:36,762 --> 00:34:38,055
What is it?

324
00:34:38,222 --> 00:34:39,431
Lie down...

325
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:52,392
Migo, I think Cara and I should go home.

326
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,378
We’ll just call a taxi.

327
00:34:55,306 --> 00:34:56,493
Why?

328
00:34:57,282 --> 00:34:59,701
She’s tired and drunk.

329
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:04,673
If you want, you can
sleep on the sofa.

330
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:07,024
Yeah, yeah...

331
00:35:07,829 --> 00:35:10,720
- We need to go home, babe...
- Babe, just rest here.

332
00:35:10,745 --> 00:35:11,773
Hmm...

333
00:35:11,798 --> 00:35:14,509
I’ll just get some water
to help sober her up.

334
00:35:14,985 --> 00:35:17,766
Okay... Take care!

335
00:35:20,978 --> 00:35:22,146
Babe...

336
00:35:23,345 --> 00:35:24,556
Help me up...

337
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:27,850
- Wait.
- Shh...

338
00:35:27,937 --> 00:35:31,563
- I want to go home...
- Shut up, babe.

339
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:35,282
- Babe...
- Just sleep here with me.

340
00:35:35,743 --> 00:35:37,212
You know...

341
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:41,141
I have a film project with...

342
00:35:42,913 --> 00:35:43,913
Ella.

343
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:46,852
- Project?
- Yeah, film project.

344
00:35:47,117 --> 00:35:49,099
Wait, wait...

345
00:35:49,722 --> 00:35:51,211
here it is.

346
00:35:51,306 --> 00:35:52,306
Look.

347
00:35:53,376 --> 00:35:54,446
[giggling]

348
00:35:55,674 --> 00:35:57,977
What the hell?
What’s this?

349
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:01,321
- You like it?
- Are you messing with me?

350
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:04,540
So you’re the only one
who gets to have sex with others?

351
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:05,829
[chuckles]

352
00:36:06,524 --> 00:36:08,461
- The hell...
- Woah, woah!

353
00:36:08,587 --> 00:36:10,493
Wait...

354
00:36:10,707 --> 00:36:13,953
Isn’t this every guy’s fantasy?

355
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:17,759
Girl on girl action!

356
00:36:18,363 --> 00:36:19,626
You’re disgusting!

357
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,789
What did you do to my girlfriend?

358
00:36:24,999 --> 00:36:27,266
This has to be your influence!

359
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:30,226
- What’s going on?
- That!

360
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:38,980
Cara... what did you do?

361
00:36:39,005 --> 00:36:43,141
I just showed Migo our project.

362
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,251
You know what?

363
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:47,297
Just get out!
Both of you, leave!

364
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:51,149
[groans] I heard you... Wait.

365
00:36:54,149 --> 00:36:55,234
Screw you!

366
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:07,079
Do you remember anything
from last night?

367
00:37:08,997 --> 00:37:10,579
Last night?

368
00:37:10,793 --> 00:37:12,391
Mmm...

369
00:37:12,511 --> 00:37:15,587
I remember you dancing with Paul,

370
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:18,712
while you were making out.

371
00:37:19,821 --> 00:37:22,516
And he was grinding
his dick against you.

372
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:24,276
Cara, that’s not what I meant.

373
00:37:25,549 --> 00:37:28,302
You don’t remember
what you did to Migo?

374
00:37:28,602 --> 00:37:31,464
You showed him the PleasureHub.

375
00:37:31,741 --> 00:37:33,041
I know.

376
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,955
He’s been texting me all sorts of crap.

377
00:37:36,834 --> 00:37:38,159
Says I’m trash.

378
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:40,247
So, what’s your plan?

379
00:37:43,985 --> 00:37:45,034
Plan?

380
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,315
Well...

381
00:37:49,235 --> 00:37:51,081
If he can’t accept what I do,

382
00:37:52,082 --> 00:37:53,250
he doesn’t deserve me.

383
00:37:55,432 --> 00:37:57,017
What’s important is...

384
00:37:58,116 --> 00:37:59,201
are you still in?

385
00:37:59,832 --> 00:38:01,208
Of course.

386
00:38:02,542 --> 00:38:05,170
And I don't care if I lose Migo,

387
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:07,751
as long as it's not you.

388
00:38:08,749 --> 00:38:12,127
Why would you lose me?
I’m not going anywhere.

389
00:38:24,323 --> 00:38:25,699
What are you doing?

390
00:38:31,405 --> 00:38:34,116
Don’t you feel what I feel?

391
00:38:35,274 --> 00:38:36,877
What are we, Ella?

392
00:38:38,607 --> 00:38:40,276
What are you talking about?

393
00:38:41,076 --> 00:38:42,911
Of course you’re my friend.

394
00:38:43,344 --> 00:38:44,718
Come on, Ella.

395
00:38:44,836 --> 00:38:48,138
This is all new to you...

396
00:38:48,456 --> 00:38:50,082
Maybe you’re just confused.

397
00:39:42,397 --> 00:39:45,525
Stop harassing Ella!
Stop it with me too!

398
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,000
Why?

399
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:49,781
Your friend is really a slut, right?

400
00:39:49,991 --> 00:39:51,326
She even got you involved.

401
00:39:55,886 --> 00:39:57,512
Your dick is so small, asshole!

402
00:39:57,594 --> 00:40:00,127
[people laughing]

403
00:40:00,152 --> 00:40:01,237
What are you laughing at?

404
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:17,090
Can we talk?

405
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:32,901
I'm so sorry. It's fine
if you don't like me back.

406
00:40:32,926 --> 00:40:35,231
But please, let's be friends.

407
00:41:05,806 --> 00:41:06,849
Okay!

408
00:41:07,505 --> 00:41:10,973
You nosy assholes!

409
00:41:12,032 --> 00:41:14,826
You really want to know
why Cara isn't here?

410
00:41:19,873 --> 00:41:21,372
English your face!

411
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,598
Cara confessed to me.

412
00:41:28,509 --> 00:41:29,969
She said...

413
00:41:31,363 --> 00:41:32,856
she likes me.

414
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,669
What am I supposed to say to that?

415
00:41:38,755 --> 00:41:40,936
Do I not want to lose her?

416
00:41:41,425 --> 00:41:42,426
I don't!

417
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,466
Do I not want to hurt her?

418
00:41:47,757 --> 00:41:48,883
Of course...

419
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:58,106
Am I jealous when
she's with her ex?

420
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:00,728
I think so...

421
00:42:02,866 --> 00:42:03,992
I don't know.

422
00:42:17,055 --> 00:42:18,161
Whatever...

423
00:42:19,842 --> 00:42:21,176
All I know is,

424
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,872
she's important to me.

425
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,352
Is that love?

426
00:42:31,025 --> 00:42:32,067
Maybe...

427
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:48,466
I'm sorry.

428
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:50,910
I'm sorry.

429
00:42:55,910 --> 00:42:59,090
I heard everything.
I heard it all...

430
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:03,145
We'll figure this out, okay?

431
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,895
We'll figure this out.
